With the polygon tool active, the pointer changes to cross hairs when you move the pointer over the image in the figure. Using the mouse, you specify the region by selecting vertices of the polygon. You can move or resize the polygon using the mouse.

By clicking on the eye icon on the side of each overlay you can toggle the presence.\n\n\nFor a general overview you can watch our first CellOverlay \ntutorial video\n too!\n\n\nNotice: This example uses the original skeleton image as background but the overlays can be generated on any other image as well (e.g. raw image, second channel ecc.) the only limitation is that dimensions must match (x,y,t).\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a new overlay\n\n\n\n\nLet's add a new overlay to the test viewer (click again on TestLoader if you closed it). Here we will add a graph view overlay which visualizes the neighborhood connectivity of every cell.\n\n\n\n\nOpen the CellOverlay plugin from the toolbar\n\n\nSelect \nGRAPH VIEW\n from the Overlay list (see summary figure below)\n\n\nGenerate the overlay by clicking \nAdd Overlay\n on the plugin bottom\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA new overlay is now present on the image and a new entry in the Layer menu:\n\n\n\n\nAdjusting a gradient color overlay\n\n\n\n\nWhen the overlay displays a gradient through a color scheme like in the Area example the user can adjust the scheme through the 4 parameters in the OptionPanel in the Layer menu (see image below). The \nGradient Maximum\n and \nGradient Minimum\n parameters set the extremes of the gradient (everything above and below has constant color). The \nGradient Scale\n is a multiplier between 0 and 1 to scale the color gradient into a particular range of colors (see \nHSV color scheme\n for more information about the color space).

The latter automatically saves ASCII files containing the 2nd estimated surface by GridFit\u00a9 [1]. \n\n\nThe surface/height map files can be found in the \nAnalysis/\n folder under \nvtk/gridfit_frame_###.vtk\n. Every line in these files represents a coordinate in the surface grid (i.e. x,y,z). Starting from EpiTools plugins for icy \nversion 0.8.7\n we provide two tools to use these files, one to visualize the surface as 3D rendering (CellSurface) and the other to evaluate the position of cells in 3D (CellProjection overlay).\n\n\nWe provide example files \nhere\n to generate the visualizations below.\n\n\nCellSurface\n\n\nRequisites:\n icy plugin 3D Mesh ROI plugin [2]\n\n\nThe \nCellSurface\n plugin visualizes the height map as 3D rendering, leveraging on the 3D Mesh ROI plugin [2] and the VTK library [3] integrated in icy. Time series are supported by assigning individual ROIs to specific frames, allowing the user to inspect the morphological changes of the surface over time.\n\n\nTo load our example:\n\n\n\n\nOpen \nframe_000.tif\n and the CellSurface plugin\n\n\nSet \ngridfit_frame_000.vtk\n as input vtk file\n\n\nVerify the pixel size in the Sequence Properties (Icy Side Bar) to scale the surface correctly, for the example it should be (x = y = 0.102um) and (z = 0.219um) see (A.) \n\n\nSelect 3DVTK mode in the sequence viewer (2nd menu from the left) (B.) \n\n\nTry the decimate option for better performance and less memory use in case of time series (C.) \n\n\nRun the plugin (triangle)\n\n\nThe Surface can be saved as \nROI XML file\n in the ROI menu (D.)\n\n\n\n\nFor more information about the decimation method visit the dedicated \nvtk documentation page\n\n\n[WARNING] Currently we do not support registered data as the translation is applied after surface export\n \n\n[WARNING] If used on a z-stack, leaving the 3DVTK starts cpu intesive computation by 3D mesh roi plugin to adapt the ROI in 2D, to avoid this we suggest removing the ROI beforehand.\n\n\n\n\nCellProjection\n\n\nThe \nCellProjection\n overlay for the \nCellOverlay plugin\n visualizes as color gradient the magnitude of the z-component from the surface normal of every cell. The overlay uses the estimated height map to assign z-coordinates to all coordinates of the cell\u2019s polygon. To compute the apporximated 3D surface normal for every cells we use Newell\u2019s method [4]. The z-component of the surface normal is useful to estimate the area projection bias through the proportional dependence between 3D and projected 2D area [5].

As for time of writing (January 2016) v1 has only a slightly more reduced GUI functionality (limited comparison mode and viewing mode) but offers all modules as EpiTools for Matlab V2 as well as a command line access (you can find a sample script in the main directory).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfor Matlab versions after \n2014a\n: \n\n\n\n\nWith the release of Matlab version 2014b Mathworks changed the GUI system, which we had leveraged on to build the EpiTools for Matlab GUI, and how java programs are interfaced with it. Adapting to these changes and keeping the retrocompatability requires a major change in the code and we currently evaluating several options as solution. \n\n\nFeel free to write us if you have suggestions or comments on how to solve the compatability with future Matlab versions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich Matlab toolboxes are required?\n\n\n\n\nImage Processing Toolbox\n\n\nStatistics Toolbox\n\n\n\n\nIs parallel computing supported?\n\n\n\n\nCurrently (v.2.1.5) \nparallel computing support is broken\n due to a software regression and the challenge to support multiple Matlab versions, which handle Matlab workers differently.\n\n\nPlease do not change the default number of Processors unless you are making custom modifications to the code.\n\n\nNotice: The Parallel Computing Toolbox is required for this feature\n\n\n\n\nWhy are there two tracking algorithms in EpiTools?\n\n\n\n\nThe tracking algorithm in EpiTools for Matlab (i.e. the assisted correction step) is optimized to be fast in order to allow a fluent user interaction. This means that it does not extract any information about divisions or eliminations or resist stronger time shifts. This is why we build a more elaborate algorithm in icy. \n\n\nThe graph matching algorithms included in EpiTools for Icy are able to detect divisions and eliminations as well as resist better to local movement (e.g. swapping). So whenever the icy tracking is viable we recommend it. The included variants (\"stable marriage\" and \"hungarian\") apply the same weighing schemes but differ in the way the optimal matching is computed, the hungarian being more global oriented and thus more time-consuming.\n\n\nNevertheless, if the Matlab tracking is preferred, you can export the tracking information by clicking on the 3rd icon from the right in the tracking GUI (see screenshot [1]). The generated csv files can be imported in icy (see screenhot [2]).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs it possible to apply the same projection to another image channel\n\n\n\n\nUnfortunately this is currently not possible through our GUI but if you are fine with using the Matlab command line you can use the Surfaces.mat (2nd output of the Projection step) file to do it. The latter stores the z-origin number of every pixel in the projected image. We provide a small example script that shows how to apply it to an indivual time point. You can download it \nhere\n.\n\n\n\n\nHow to export the result of an intermediate step as tiff image\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can export images as tiff through the context menu, by clicking on the relative item in the left panel and selecting the TIFF export option. (See screenshot below for the clahe step)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively you can also send the images directly to icy from matlab, for this method you can find more information in Quick Guide \nConnecting icy\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis page was written by \nDavide Heller\n on 05.02.2016@15:30\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){\n  (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),\n  m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)\n  })(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga');\n\n  ga('create', 'UA-55332946-1', 'auto');\n  ga('send', 'pageview');",
