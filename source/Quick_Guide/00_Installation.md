# Installation
---------------------------------------

EpiTools comes in a single flavour as software package for Matlab. We suggest to use the lastest Matlab version available (2014a) since we developed and tested for retrocompatibility only for a small number of old Matlab releases.
At this time of the developing plan, you will still need a full and licenced installation on Matlab since our program is just a wrapped ensamble of matlab and c++ functions working together. 

## How to install it and receive our latest patches or updates


---------------------------------------
#### Installing EpiTools from our website

From the [home page](https://epitools.github.io) of EpiTools you can easily download the latest available version of EpiTools. This comes as a package where you will find only the needed files (no deprecated functions, crap files none wants on his machine). This is the most polished and clean version of EpiTools. 

1. Download the package from [here](https://github.com/epitools/epitools-matlab/releases)
2. Explode the package
3. From the directory generated by exploding the package, double click on the launcher file correspondent to your operative system. 
4. Done!


In case the launcher complains as follows:

		EpiTools_mac: Permission denied

follow these instructions from a new console windows (in OsX, open a new Terminal session). 

		cd directory-where-you-downloaded-and-exploded-epitools
		chmod +x EpiTools_mac
	

**Q: updates?**

A: We are working on a nice and neat implementation of auto updates. Unfortunately we are not ready yet to provide them automatically from EpiTools framework. However, the package you find here on our website will be always the latest version of our software! 

**Q: Command line access?**

A: To ensure the best GUI flexibility with Epitools for matlab V2  we had to disable the command line access for now. You can still download EpiTools for matlab V1 with command line support from 
<a href="https://github.com/epitools/epitools-misc">here</a>. A simple tutorial script called EpiTools_CommandLine.m is provided as example in the main archive folder.

#### Installing EpiTools from the git repository

Once you granted access to our repository, installing EpiTools is a piece of cake. You just have to clone our repository from our online versioning system (Bitbucket, a manager for GIT and MERCURIAL repositories).

Git comes automatically if you are using any version of SourceTree or any other gui software of your choice [(here a selection)](http://git-scm.com/downloads/guis).

You can do it in two different ways according to how do you feel about using the terminal or GUI applications.
