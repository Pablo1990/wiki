## Open an analysis file

Analysis files can be generated and executed on a certain machine or executed on another one as well. In order to guarantee file/directory integrity between platforms the software asks some questions in case the analysis folder or the image directory are not found. 

---------------------------------------
#### Opening an analysis file previously generated on the same machine

1. From the main EpiTools interface, click on *File>Open Analysis*.
2. Specify the path where the analysis file has been previously saved.
3. Done!

#### Opening an analysis file previously generated on another machine

1. From the main EpiTools interface, click on *File>Open Analysis*.
2. Specify the path where the analysis file has been previously saved.
3. The program will complain if the absolute paths stored for image directory and analysis directory do not correspond between the machine where the file has been generated and the one where the file has been opened. In this case the software throws an exception asking the user to indicate where the folders have been moved. 
4. Specify the new location of the unfound directories
5. Done!
